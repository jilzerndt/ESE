# TODOs and overview

## P1 - Setup HW
[x] write helloworld and run (if it doesn't work restart laptop and try again that worked last time)

## U1 - Traffic Light and Washing Machine Design
[x] Design Traffic light and how to improve it
[x] design state machine for functioning washign machine 
[x] fix washing machine diagram
[] send new diagram per mail?

## U2 - Implement Washing machine for CT board
[x] implement state machine
[x] implement action handler (leds)
[x] implement event handler (switches)
[] run on CT board and show in lab

## U3 - implement washing machine for new HW (HW abstraction)
- state machine stays exactly the same
[x] implement action handler (gpio and active low)
[x] implement event handler (real sensors)
[] run on other HW and show in lab

## P2 - Energy measurement
[x] implement state machine
[x] energy measurements
[x] low power mode
[x] oszi -> voltage curves analysis
[] understand energy cost of cryptography
[] answer questions in pdf
[] show in lab

## P3 - AES auf APU und RPU
[] AES implementation (APU)
[] AES implementation (RPU) -> remote procedure
[] timing measurements RPU
[] different message sizes
[] secret message
[] performance comparison

## P4 - AES in FPGA und CSU
