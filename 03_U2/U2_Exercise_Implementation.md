# Exercise 2 - Modelling and Implementation

After modeling the washing machine control system in last week’s exercise, it’s time to bring things 
to action. From the washing machine supplier, you receive SW libraries that shall be used to control 
the washing machine. The functionality of the libraries and the HW schematics of the washing 
machine are available in Annex A and B, respectively.  
 
## Tasks: 
• Read the annexes and check the available code to understand the code snippets the washing 
machine supplier provided. 
• Define a modular structure of your software and define an API for all Inputs and Outputs for 
your washing machine. 
• Implement the state machine according to your own specification from last week’s exercise 
by extending the Keil uvision project available on Moodle 
• Create mockup functions for all HW accesses implementing your defined API, so that the 
available buttons, dip switches and LEDs of the CT board can be used to emulate the washing 
machine.  
• Describe, how you proceed to test your implementation. Can you guarantee that the 
washing machine works as expected? Does it work as described in last week’s requirements?  
 
Present your solution to the lecturer.
