initial requirements:
- every car lane must have a traffic light
- every pedestrian crosswalk must have traffic lights in both directions
- crossing car lanes must never be green at the same time
- every crosswalk must have request buttons on both sides
- when a crosswalk is green, there must be no crossing car lane that is green

feedback:
- replace "crossing" with a more unambiguous word like "intersecting"
- replace "green" with something like "allowed to proceed"
- "request buttons" defines an implementation
- clearly state that pedestrians can request a crossing

improved requirements:
- every car lane must have a traffic light
- every pedestrian crosswalk must have traffic lights in both directions
- intersecting car lanes must never be allowed to proceed at the same time
- every crosswalk must allow pedestrians from either side to request a crossing
- when a pedestrian is allowed to proceed, no car lane intersecting their crosswalk should be allowed to proceed
